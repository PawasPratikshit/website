        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a predoctoral fellow on the European Research Council project “Elections, Violence, and Parties” at the University of Amsterdam, where Dr. Ursula Daxecker serves as the principal investigator. My primary research interests lie in understanding the determinants, nature, and extent of electoral fraud from a comparative perspective. I am also interested in the mobilization tactics of political parties and their internal organizational structures.</p>
        <p>I previously worked as a Research Associate at the Centre for Policy Research with Dr. Rahul Verma, where we collaborated on a project examining the positioning of political rallies by parties and their electoral effects. I have also served as a Teaching Fellow in the Department of Political Science at Ashoka University. Together with Dr. Verma, I co-authored an article published in Economic and Political Weekly on the performance of the Indian National Congress in the 2024 elections. A link to the publication can be found in the publications section.</p>
        <p>I have completed my MA in Political Science with a specialization in political behavior from the School of Research at Sciences Po, Paris. My master’s thesis focused on the partisan perception of election outcomes in Madhya Pradesh, India. I conducted a primary survey of 210 members of a political party and employed a mixed-methods design to analyze the findings.</p>
