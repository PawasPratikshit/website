                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a teaching fellow in the Political Science Department at Ashoka University, working with Dr. Rahul Verma. My research interests lie at the intersection of political behavior and the political economy of developing countries, with a regional specialization in India and France.

                    Dr. Verma and I have recently published together in the Economic and Political Weekly in India on the performance of the INC in the 2024 elections. A link to the publication is available in the publications section.

                    I have completed my MA in Political Science with a specialization in political behavior from the School of Research at Sciences Po, Paris. My masterâ€™s thesis focused on the partisan perception of election outcomes in Madhya Pradesh, India. I conducted a primary survey of 210 political party members and employed a mixed-methods design to analyze the findings.
